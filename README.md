## About

This repository contains a collection of AWS projects that I have worked on. Each project is designed to demonstrate best practices in cloud security, automation, and infrastructure management on AWS. Whether you're just getting started with AWS or looking to enhance your cloud security posture, you'll find valuable resources and examples here.

## Projects

### 1. AWS Infrastructure Setup

This project focuses on setting up a robust and scalable AWS infrastructure from scratch. It includes:

- **VPC Creation**: Setting up a Virtual Private Cloud with subnets, route tables, and security groups.
- **IAM Configuration**: Creating and managing IAM roles, policies, and users.
- **EC2 Instances**: Launching and configuring EC2 instances with proper security measures.
- **S3 Buckets**: Setting up S3 buckets with appropriate access controls and encryption.

### 2. Security Best Practices

This project highlights various security best practices for AWS environments, including:

- **Encryption**: Implementing encryption at rest and in transit for data.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Setting up CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and other monitoring tools.
- **Network Security**: Configuring security groups, NACLs, and VPC flow logs.
- **Access Management**: Enforcing MFA, least privilege, and role-based access controls.

### 3. Automated Compliance Checks

This project demonstrates how to automate compliance checks using AWS Config, including:

- **Rule Creation**: Setting up custom AWS Config rules to enforce compliance policies.
- **Automated Remediation**: Using AWS Lambda to automatically remediate non-compliant resources.
- **Reporting**: Generating compliance reports and dashboards.

### 4. Incident Response Automation

This project covers automating incident response processes on AWS, such as:

- **Detection**: Setting up real-time threat detection with AWS GuardDuty.
- **Response Automation**: Using AWS Lambda and Step Functions to automate response actions.
- **Forensics**: Collecting and analyzing logs and other forensic data.
